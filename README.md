# MrXmasDiskGen
MATLAB function to generate custom music box disks

## Usage
Take midi file less than 28 seconds and scaled to white keys in the range from C3-A5.  Produce silhoutte images for disks that will play on a Mr Christmas Symphonium music box. Inkscape was then used to convert the images to svg (vector graphics) files.  A K40 laser was then used to cut new disks from polypropylene sheets.  

A demo is shown here:
